### Why XGBoost is a Stronger Alternative to Traditional Gradient Boosting

✅ **Faster Training**: XGBoost leverages parallelization and efficient boosting algorithms (like the approximate greedy algorithm) to process large datasets much faster than traditional GB.

✅ **Better Generalization**: Built-in regularization (L1, L2) helps prevent overfitting while maintaining high accuracy.

✅ **Scalability**: Supports computation on both CPUs and GPUs, and integrates well with distributed systems, making it suitable for large-scale projects.

✅ **Flexibility**: Offers support for custom loss functions, handles missing values gracefully, and allows fine control over tree structure (depth, minimum samples, etc.).
